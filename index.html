        </ul>

        <h2><span class="section-number">4.</span> HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        
        <p>
          <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).
        </p>

        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">5.</span> HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

        </p>

        <p>
          However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2><span class="section-number">7.</span> CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        
        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
